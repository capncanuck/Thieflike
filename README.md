THIEFLIKE
=========

A roguelike written for learning and fun!


Description
-----------

Thieflike is a minimal roguelike written to better understand the process
of writing a game in Haskell, and seperating console code from gui code, while
following the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself. This is not meant to be a fully-featured 
roguelike, just something fun.


Usage
-----
I've only tried this out on Linux Mint 13, and OSX 10.7.

`$ cabal install
 $ Thieflike`
